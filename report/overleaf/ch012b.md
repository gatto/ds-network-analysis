#### Extracting child hashtags
Once we identified the parent hashtags, we extracted a list of child hashtags to assign to each of the 3 parent hashtags. These sets of children + parent make up each of our 3 categories.
To extract the tweets we made a single query to the Twitter API containing the 3 parent hashtags: `#slavaukraini OR #istandwithputin OR #stopwarinukraine`. We collected a fixed, maximum number of tweets responding to the query, and after several attempts we found that the maximum that our PC could work on was 800,000, which is the number of tweets used for this phase. 
To ensure the relevance of each hashtag worked we have created 3 thresholds: *threshold_support*, *threshold_certainty* and *threshold_ratio*. 

##### Support
We are only interested in hashtags that appear in a minimum number of tweets in our database. If a hashtag, for example, appears only in one tweet out of 800,000, we want to leave out that hashtag because with only one tweet we do not believe we can categorize the hashtag with high confidence. In general, we define support = fraction of tweets in which the hashtag appears calculated as
