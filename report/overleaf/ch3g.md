(Remember that before the data cleaning phase, our netowrk had larger dimensions: a number of nodes equal to 11197, number of links equal to 12767 and the network was divided into 225 different components.)

About Path analysis Our network has a diameter of 18 and an avg shortest path of 4.972121353619957, a fairly modest value even compared to those calculated on synthetic models. The model that diverges most from our real world in terms of path analysis is certainly the Watts-Strogats model with a diameter of 1065 and an average shortest path of about 409.

### Clustering & Density
#### Clustering coefficient
In our network the **Average clustering coeffcient** is 0.038, so it tends to be low being a real world network and calculating the local clustering coefficient we found that there are several nodes that have a value of the maximum localClustCoeff, ie equal to 1: most of them are proukraine nodes. 
The distribution of the measures calculated for the clustering coefficents of our network is shown in the following graph
