##### Certainty
Once we decided on the inclusion or exclusion of hashtags based on their support, we went on to calculate, for each hashtag, its scores. 
A hashtag's *score* for a given category represents that hashtag's relevance to that category, i.e. the relative frequency with which that hashtag was tweeted along with the parent hashtag for that category. Below is an example:
 
```
stophatingrussians the scores are 
proukr    0.0696 
prorus    0.4696 
pax       0.4609 
```

These 3 scores represent the fraction of the times stophatingrussians was tweeted along with the parent hashtag of its category. For example, only 6.96% of the time it was tweeted along with #slavaukraini. 
Based on the higher score we categorize each hashtag as ProUkraina, ProRussia or PaxRomana. 
However, we want there to be a minimum of certainty in categorization. Technically, a hashtag could be assigned to a category for the maximum relative score of 33.34% (relative maximum among three categories that add up to 100%). This does not satisfy us, so we have introduced the *threshold_certainty* = 0.4 which represents the minimum that the score of a hashtag must assume for the hashtag to be assigned to the category.

##### Ratio
Finally, again to ensure a minimum level of certainty in categorization, we have introduced a third treshold. We note that in the example above, surely the hashtag does not belong to the proukr category. Among the other two categories, however, prorus and pax, the difference in score is minimal between 46.96% and 46.09%. We therefore introduced another threshold, *threshold_ratio=1.2*, which allowed us to avoid a hashtag being assigned to one category rather than another with a low difference in maximum scores. The formula used is:
