## Task: Static community discovery
In trying to discover communities we employed the *Label Propagation*, *Leiden* and *Louvain* methods (non-overlapping) and *Angel* and *K-Clique* (overlapping). In this table we report the average and standard deviation of the evaluation metrics.

xxx table of metrics

According to **Newman-Girvan modularity** the best performing algos were Louvain and Leiden while k-clique and Angel performed very badly. According to **conductance** Leiden was best over Louvain by about 40% of its score.
In regards to external evaluation, for the **normalised F1 score** again were best Louvain and Leiden with scores of 0.23 while k_clique and angel reached 0.14 and Label Propagation scored less than 0.01. The **Mutual Information (MI) score normalized** - which can only be applied to non-overlapping partitionings - highlighted as best again the Louvain and Leiden with scores of 0.93 and Label Propagation as worst. 
The matrix below summarises the mutual information similarities (with the adjusted metric).
