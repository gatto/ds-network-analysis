### Synthetic graphs
To compare the results of our analysis on the Real World network (which we will call RW) created by us, we have built 4 different types of synthetic models:

- Erdos-Renyi model (ER): to make it similar to our network we set an ER with a number of nodes equal to 10184 (equal to the number of nodes in our network) and a value of p equal to 0.00025, thus obtaining an ER with a number of links similar to that of our network.
- Barabasi-Albert (BA): in this case we set a model that had 10184 nodes and a parameter m equal to 1, in order to obtain a synthetic model similar to our RW.
- Watts-Strogatz (WS): for this model we have defined the same number of nodes as our RW, parameter p equal to 0.05 and parameter k equal to 3 in order to obtain a model that had a number of links similar to ours.

In this way the models were useful to compare the results obtained for the measurements on our network comparing it with the results obtained on synthetic models.

Below is the table with the main metrics calculated on the different models:
