While about a month after the outbreak of the war the number of people who side with Ukraine increases, the following month these decrease and an increase in donations and those who support peace is detected, even if the latter are lower than t0.

It is also possible to notice how the prorus are only 416 and then in the subsequent time steps disappear completely. This can be due to several reasons:

- Twitter deleted tweets in favor of Russia, which affects the categorization, based on hashtags ([Ucraina: Twitter rimuove 50 mila contenuti fake sulla guerra - Hi-tech - ANSA](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/tecnologia/hitech/2022/03/17/ucraina-twitter-rimuove-50-mila-contenuti-fake-sulla-guerra_c02d3ff1-16d9-4650-87c4-21f0fe809d5e.html)) ([How Russian “Troll factory” tried to effect on Ukraine’s agenda.

- Russians tend to use other social platforms, such as VKontakte, as Russia has blocked access to platforms such as Twitter and Facebook ([Russia blocks access to Facebook and Twitter | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter))
- the fact that 9 days prior to the actual outbreak of war were included in the analysis, during which users could have been in a first phase of taking a position.

Through a tree it is possible to observe how the categorization of users varies from one time step to another, labeling each category with a different color node.
