### Connected components analysis and Path analysis
Continuing with the analysis of our real world network, we moved on to the analysis of connected components.
It emerged that in our current network, after the data cleaning phase seen above, there is a single giant connected component that coincides with the total network itself (N = 10184 number of nodes and L = 11968 number of links). Carrying out the same analysis on synthetic models, it emerged that two of the synthetic models (the ER model and the WS model) do not have a single connected component.
In the following table we see what emerged from the analysis on the various models:
