## Abstract
In this report we propose a study conducted through Network Science tools regarding the relationships that have developed between users who use the Twitter social network during the first weeks since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in February 2022.

## Introduction
The outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in February 2022 was an important topic of discussion on social networks. Our analysis aims to build a network inspired by the spread of debate through the observation of tweets and retweets of users worldwide.
Within our network, **nodes represent users** and **links represent interactions** between them. We have divided the users / nodes into 4 categories and the analysis carried out on tweets and hashtags has led us to analyze the trend of the same with the final goal of identifying what could be the potential future scenarios within the network, in terms of probability that a user changes its nature following an interaction with a user of a different category.

## Data collection
### Data sources
We chose Twitter as a source for data mining because we believe it is one of the most used social networks to discuss the war in question as well as being, more generally, one of the most popular platforms worldwide.
The war broke out on February 24 but we started analyzing tweets from February 15, 2022 to capture users' opinions before the actual start date, until March 15, 2022, thus considering a moment that historically has more fragmented people's opinions and in which journalistic articles have highlighted an important spread of propaganda via twitter. For most of the work, therefore, we use only one month of tweets for memory management and performance reasons, which were crucial considerations throughout the entire project due to the gigantic amount of tweets and related data and metadata. Tweets during this month were collected and a **snapshot of user interactions** was extracted using this month of tweets as a database.
For the final phase of the open question, it was necessary to widen the temporal view to more than a single period.

### Extraction methodology
Interfacing with Twitter through the official *academic API* and the *Twarc 2* library we implemented several custom classes (in the `extract` module) that allowed us to homogenize the collection of tweets according to our needs, so that all members of the group could then quickly get a `pandas.DataFrame` and/or a `csv` with tweets according to the requested query, and that the various dataframes obtained were consistent according to the same assumptions (e.g. start / end date of the search, language). In addition, due to the amount of data, memory management was crucial; thus, all efficiency operations on memory have also been centralized in the `extract` module.
Here is a description of the main classes implemented:

- *SocialETL* allows us to extract all tweets that contain a query of search terms;
- *Count* allows us to identify how often a given keyword appears;
- *UserETL* allows us to access the tweets of a specific user, according to the time periods established by us;
- *DownloadTweets*, for a specified set of tweets, collects only the attributes relevant to us and collects them in a standardized structure.

### Hashtag categorization
At this stage we have categorized the hashtags collected into 3 categories, namely **Pro Ukraine**, **Pro Russia**, **Pax Romana**.
To do this, we first manually identified 1 "parent" hashtag for each category and then extracted the "children" hashtags to be included in the category.

#### Parent hashtag selection
To identify the "parent" hashtag for each category, we identified possible candidates through manual searches on the main social networks and search engines; We then observed the frequency of each candidate in the time period of interest.
