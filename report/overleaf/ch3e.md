#### Degree distribution

The degree distribution of our Real World network (figure 3), compared with that of the synthetic models analyzed, is similar to the distribution that we find in the synthetic Barabasi-Albert model (figure 4), while it presents significant differences with the distributions of the other models in particular with that of the ER model.
In fact, the distribution in our model is in line with power law distribution (similarly to what happens for the Barabasi-Albert model), this is due to the *preferential attachment* property.
On the contrary, the distribution of our Real World Network turns out to be very different from the distribution of the Erdos-Renyi model which follows a *poissonian distribution*.
