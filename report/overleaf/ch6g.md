It is possible to notice that about 85% of users, regardless of the category they belong to in t0, will switch to the proukr category in t1, while the rest seem to be more supporters of peace. But this is not true for users who have shown that they support Russia in t0, as half of the rest will side with peace and half will disregard the topic.
As also found in the Markov chain, the majority (4094) of proukr tend to remain of the same opinion in all the time steps taken into consideration. While it is very difficult for a user who belongs to prorus, pax and dontcare to always remain in the same category.


### Conclusions and limitations
From this project it emerged that the prevailing opinion is that of the supporters of the "slavaukraini" as Twitter users prefer the victory of Ukraine at any cost. One of the relevant findings is that the more time passes since the outbreak of war, the more users tend to tweet less about war-related topics. Among all only 2 users remained dontcare in all the time steps, thus demonstrating how, in the face of such a strong theme it is almost impossible not to be involved on Twitter. It should be remembered that Twitter can sometimes be a source of information and just as often a source of misinformation. ++xxx Is this last statement to be substantiated a little?++

++xxx Is it necessary to add that this effect is also due to the fact that as an initial query of tweet search we used hashtags that we ourselves considered "dear"? But maybe I misunderstood++

One of the limitations of this project has been to categorize tweets in favor of Russia for which, as already reported above, the classification method adopted is inefficient.  Another limitation may be due to RAM, as it was not possible to collect too many tweets in the creation of hashtag lists, having to refer to a limit of 80000 tweets. Therefore, some hashtags may not have been categorized correctly and negatively affect the categorization of users. However, as far as has been demonstrated, it is considered that the proposed method can be considered efficient and can be further refined.
