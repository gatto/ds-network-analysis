*The measurements were calculated on the Largest Connected Component of the reference model 
In the following phases we will analyze specifically the results obtained for the most interesting measurements on our RW network and the various similarities / differences with the results of the same metrics obtained on synthetic models.

### Degree distribution analysis
In the first phase of the analysis of our network we examined the Basic measures focusing on the analysis of degree distribution
Table 2.1 shows some of the basic measurements of our network
