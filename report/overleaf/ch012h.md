### User categorization
We have now categorized users, via what they tweeted, into one of four categories. Three categories are the same as we have divided hashtags (proukr, prorus, pax) and the fourth is a residual category, "don't care", in which users who tweet about the war are categorized no more than a certain threshold compared to the total of their tweets.
These are the categories:

The assignment of each user to one of the first three categories was possible thanks to the analysis of the hashtags contained in their tweets in the period of interest and calculating the majority. As for the last one, it was assigned to a user through "exclusion" by setting a threshold of *"indifference"*.
To get the tweets we used the same query we used in the hashtag phase: **(#slavaukraini OR #stopwarinukraine OR #istandwithputin)** and obtained a dataframe of 44812 lines, of which each line is formed by a tweet. Again, the maximum number of tweets used was taken as the maximum number that our computing resources allowed us.

The authors of these tweets are 32382 distinct users.

#### Tweet Categorization
Each tweet was categorized into one of the top 3 classes based on the hashtags it contained, with the simple majority rule. 
In the event that a tweet had a tie between two or more classes (example, in the same tweet, two hashtags proukr, 1 prorus and two hashtag pax), that tweet is deleted.

#### User Categorization
Once we categorized the selected tweets, we moved on to the categorization of the user himself. 
At this stage we have introduced the categorization of the "don't care" category through a 10% *indifference threshold*. 
If less than 10% of tweets belonging to the user are related to war (prorus, proukr or pax), the user is categorized as don't care; 
Otherwise, the simple majority method of his tweets is used to categorize the user as prorus, proukr or pax. In case of a tie, again, the user is discarded. 

### Data cleaning and network building
Our network has been created with:
- Nodes: twitter users who have posted at least one of the tweets included in our database;
- Links: interactions between users, understood as retweets. There is a link between two users if one has retweeted a tweet of the other.
To each node we have assigned as a property in networkx the category of the user. We eliminated self loops and isolated nodes and got the following network:

- number of nodes = 11197
- number of edges = 12767
- number of components = 225

It resulted in a giant component and the other small components having a size in a range of [2-39] nodes.
For this reason, for the purposes of this project, we decided to focus only on the Giant Component, removing the small ones, obtaining the following final network: 

- TOTALE LINK= 11968
- TOTALE USERS/NODES = 10184
- proukr = 6922
- pax = 2165
- prorus = 416
- nocare = 681
