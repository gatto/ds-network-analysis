With this threshold we therefore want to make sure that the hashtag is included in the most appropriate list: if for a hashtag its maximum score reaches less than 20% more than the median score, we believe that there is not enough difference and therefore we discard the hashtag for violation of the *threshold_ratio*.
Continuing the example above, we can see how the hashtag "stophatingrussians" is then discarded and not placed in any of the three categories of hashtags. In order not to violate the *threshold_ratio*, however, a hashtag with a maximum score of 0.47 its median score should have been **no more than** 0.47 / 1.2 = **0.39**.

##### Semantical cleaning
A final processing was to remove what for us were "neutral hashtags", which pass the threshold_support as they are widely used hashtags, but which we believe do not represent opinions about the war. 
Among these we divided between "neutral", or **geographical places** that semantically it is difficult to categorize, and "trends", those hashtags used to increase views but that did not indicate a position of thought. This processing, the "semantical cleaning", is the only one that has been carried out manually by the three of us.
We show the final result of categorizing hashtags as the number of hashtags in each category and as wordclouds.
